# Change management

## Hand-over community leadership

* Provide opportunities to lead as well (introduce speakers, organize events, ...)
* Hand-over access to resources (domain names, contacts, code repositories, meetup)
* Remove your link from chapter G+ page as organizer
* Stand-by for a while :-)
